== squareplay - a simple square dance oriented music player ==

I was struggling to get SqView running under Wine on Linux, so I
started slinging code. This is extremely rough, but requires:

* Python, I'm using Python 3
* VLC
* Gtk3 with the Glade library

More as I get further along, this checkin is just minimal enough to
get a "I hope this works for calling tomorrow night" state.
